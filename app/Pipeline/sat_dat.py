# Fourier infilling probably shouldn't happen here if I'm storing the files in GRIB format, unless I want to update GRIB files which seems tricky

# Therefore this file will simply contain the following functions within a class



## Get files from NOAA

	## Maybe build link to get files based on time and link format for NOAA


## Upload files to S3 bucket

	## Maybe rename files for easier future access
